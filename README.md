This is a FineTuned and Quantized LLM for Mental Health ChatBot using Q-lora This has been implemented with an epoch of 40 while the standard refined dataset requires a minimum accuracy of 100 epochs. This dataset consists of 200 of the variety questions that can be asked to a mental health chatbot (very generalized for exact replication of medical diagnosis) and provides accurate results as per the excel sheet provided in this repository. These questions must be framed to the Nadi interface as per given in the excel sheet. Any questions asked beyond what is given in the excel sheet will return an unsatisfactory result.
